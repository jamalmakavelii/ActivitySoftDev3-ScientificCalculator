# ActivitySoftDev3-ScientificCalculator
This code is a Python program for a calculator that can perform basic mathematical operations and more advanced operations like square root, logarithms, factorial, and trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent) with the option to work in either degrees or radians. The user is prompted to choose a unit (degrees or radians) and then enter an expression. The program evaluates the expression, taking into account the chosen unit, and displays the result. The user can continue entering expressions, clear the calculator, or exit the program. It also supports exiting the program by typing 'exit'.
